# MediScoreCalculator
A simple rule of thumb score used to identify ill patients.

I decided to split each property into separate functions to allow for easier debugging and better readability of my code. I ensured that the end output was user friendly and that the entirety of the inputs are easy to understand as I gave the user options on which letters to enter, for the air or oxygen and ACVPU properties.
